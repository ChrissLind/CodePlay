## About :blue_book:
Have you ever wanted to show off your code but only have your phone? Maybe want to write a function to help automate some aspect of your life?

_codePocket is a fun way to showcase simple funtions that you have made, on the go. As developers we have all had moments where we think to ourselves "I think I could write something in <preferredlanguage> to do this!" sometimes for even the simpleist of things, like simiulating a dice roll. 
 
With _codePocket we want you to bring your code with you on your phone, and be able to run it and show it off anywhere at any time!
