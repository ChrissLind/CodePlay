## About :blue_book:
Have you ever wanted to show off your code but only have your phone? Or maybe you want to write a function to help automate some aspect of your life?

\_codePocket is a fun way to showcase simple functions that you have made, on the go. As developers we have all had moments where we think to ourselves "I think I could write something in \<preferredlanguage\> to do this!" sometimes for even the simpleist of things, like simulating a dice roll. 
 
With \_codePocket we want you to bring your code with you on your phone, and be able to run it and show it off anywhere at any time!
